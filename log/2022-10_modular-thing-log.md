OK, spinning up some kind of thing for this now. AFAIK I can ~ more or less use the standing OSAP bottom-end. I have a few clear tasks to begin:

- osape / osape-arduino stubs into an arduino project for this board of quentin's design 
- js auto-opening pipe, 

Then a few less clear tasks:

- do we plumb things -> up, so we use "efficient" data transfer ? 
- wrap up a "virtual thing" class, and which methods are exposed ?
- that's it, right ? give leo some handlers 

## The Toolchains Trouble

- can build a new fab-core that uses g7
- and use an arduino library 

OK I ended up... porting OSAP as a library, wasn't that bad. Should be in a better mood more often. Onwards then... 

## JS Auto-Open 

This I've done before...
