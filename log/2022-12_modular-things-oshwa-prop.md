## OSHWA Workshop Proposal 

Ok we have

- title 
- summary (150 words)
- keywords (3 identifying terms)
- description (500 words)
- photographs (max 2)
- video (one) 

I think the video is probably the most key; we want to show:

- modular-thing can lower the barrier to hardware entry, 
  - it's the zero-docs approach to sharing an OSHW module 
- and can make it easier to use multiple projects in one meta-project,
- and interface between tiny UIs / applications, and hardware
- and *of course* we can make just about any device into a modular-thing, by virtualizing it! 
- we can even make medium-complex projects, like machines 
- like xylophones... 

### Title

- modular-things: a new, playful way to build microcontroller projects
- modular-things: plug-and-play with virtualized hardware 

### Summary (150 words)

modular-things presents a new way to rapidly build hardware projects, with modular... things! A series of devices (motors! sensors! OLEDs! solenoids! etc!) are virtualized into javascript objects, and enumerated over USB...

### Description (500 words max)

... modular-things is:
... in the workshop, we want to bring a kit of modular-things circuits, and... fuck around with them? and (maybe?) show folks how to develop new modular-things, with a breadboard project...
