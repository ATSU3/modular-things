## OSHWA Workshop Proposal 

Ok we have

- title 
- summary (150 words)
- keywords (3 identifying terms)
- description (500 words)
- photographs (max 2)
- video (one) 

I think the video is probably the most key; we want to show:

- modular-thing can lower the barrier to hardware entry, 
  - it's the zero-docs approach to sharing an OSHW module 
- and can make it easier to use multiple projects in one meta-project,
- and interface between tiny UIs / applications, and hardware
- and *of course* we can make just about any device into a modular-thing, by virtualizing it! 
- we can even make medium-complex projects, like machines 
- like xylophones... 

### Title

- modular-things: a new, playful way to build microcontroller projects
- modular-things: plug-and-play with virtualized hardware 

### Summary (150 words)

Modular-Things presents a new way to rapidly build hardware projects. We developed a set of dedicated input/output devices which can be programmed from a high level programming environment that runs in the browser. Each device presents its own API as soon as it's plugged in, so users can focus on using the tools for their functionality instead of puzzling over how to wire them together. The system is extensible by allowing users to easily create their own "things" with Arduino. Modular-Things makes it quicker and easier to build physical computing systems. It also provides a framework for season hardware developers to create specialized deviced which can be easily integrated into other projects.

### Description (500 words max)

We present a system for making the development of physical computing systems interactive, extensible, and modular. We want to make working with hardware more like working with software. The current process for programming microcontrollers involves recompiling and flashing firmware upon any change to software or hardware systems. This is due to the tight coupling of the code which runs on an MCU and the peripherals plugged into that device. 

“Modular-Things” provides users with a set of circuit boards each with a dedicated function such as measuring distance, turning a motor, or a dial. When these devices are plugged into a computer they present a unique identifier and a description of what functionality they have. From the host computer a user can then write programs in a high level language such as JavaScript which can integrate the collection of boards into a single system. If the user wants to add a new input or output, all they have to do is plug in another board. Additionally from the host computer the user can create a graphical interface in HTML/CSS/JavaScript for interacting with the physical device they made.

"Modular-Things" is a kit of parts but also a system for developing parts. Modular thing developers can create new “things” as easily as programming an Arduino. Specialized parts can be developed independently and later integrated with each other. The system is built upon OSAP (Open Systems Assembly Protocol) a small message passing layer that provides naming, routing and flowcontrol services to modular hardware and software using source-routed packets.

We also developed a set of mechanical machine building components which make it easy to create composable axes. Modular-Things supports sychronized stepper motor control for multi-degree of freedom machines.

During our workshop we will present the modular-things system by building with it. We will build whimsical music machines using Modular-Things boards and our construction kit of machine building components. We'll be able to assemble the mechanical and electrical hardware for these machines, program them in the modular-things IDE, and create web interfaces to control them.


... modular-things is:
... in the workshop, we want to bring a kit of modular-things circuits, and... fuck around with them? and (maybe?) show folks how to develop new modular-things, with a breadboard project...
